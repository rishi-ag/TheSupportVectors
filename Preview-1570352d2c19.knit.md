#Introduction




# 1. Data Preprocessing
We first separated the labels from the features and created a function to



Two standardization procedures were conducted for the continuous variables (1-10):
1. Centred the data around the mean and divided by the standard deviation.
2. Rescale the data from -1 to 1.

# 2. Modelling

There were different models tried and the parameters were optimized for each method using the AWS. More specificcally:

1. K-NN model: We implemeted the standardized data and the raw data for K-NN for the odd cases between 1-21 in order to check which gives the higher accuracy. We got the following results. <b>In the end</b> it turned out that 1-NN method provides the best results.
